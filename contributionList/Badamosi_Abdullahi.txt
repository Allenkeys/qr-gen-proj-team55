My name is Badamosi Abdullahi Oluwatobi 
I was the one in charge of the dashboard design which is one of the prominent page of the project
I make sure i designed a useful and usable page that is aesthetically pleasing.
I also helped some of my teammates in making good decision about their designs and add some constructive reviews.
I also helped in effective collaboration with the developers to build a successful project.
I'd say i learned a lot in this project phase and most importantly that good collaboration is effective in building a successful project.
Attached here is the link to our figma board where you can see the dashboard i designed.
