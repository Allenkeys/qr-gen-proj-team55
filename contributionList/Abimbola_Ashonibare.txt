My name is Abimbola Ashonibare and I am a product designer.
I worked along side other product designers, as well as developers on the QR code generation website for team 55.

I worked on developing the style guide that was used in this project along side some other designers.
I was charged with the responsibility of creating the colour styles which was of utmost important to this project. 
It was important that we used the right set of colours for the website.
I created the grid style that was used for this project as well.
Also, I created all the button styles for both the desktop view and the mobile view. I made sure to create all 
the various button states as well as shapes.

Here is a link to the figma board that shows the style guide created.

For the design of the website itself, I worked on the landing page. 
I ensured the proper alignment of every single item on the website was in line with our 4 point system.
I also ensured the illustrations used were of the right size for the website. Also, I ensured the font size for 
the landing page was just perfect.
I created the landing design for the mobile view as well.
Also, I ensured the overall aesthetics of the landing page was beautiful.

Here is a link to the figma board for the landing page.
