I am Akobi, Mutiat Adeoti.
I worked in my team as a developer.
I worked along side other developers and the product designers, on the QR code generation web application for team 55.

I worked on writing the views for the featured functions of this app.
I did proof-reading of some of the files and made corrections in places I deemed necesary.
I also reshuffled files and folders for accessibility of the team and declutering of the repository.
I worked on the first presentation and will be presenting the final presentation.

The following are the links to my commits so far:
