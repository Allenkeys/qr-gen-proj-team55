My name is Timileyin Lasisi
During the course of the project i worked on toggle buttons for style guide
I and my co-designer Atiku worked on the settings screen 
I always made sure i communicated with our product designer team lead whenever there needs to be changes 
I also helped by contributing to the pain points, user persona and user stories
I could say i learnt a lot during this project, good communication and great collaboration is needed to get the project done
Hard work and resilience, making researches on the project as well
Here is the link to the settings screen we were able to put together
